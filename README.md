# NGSDataParsing

The BasesCovered.py scripts are similar but seperate for different BAM files. They are used in the directory of interest that contains the BAM and BAI files and run to gather read depth for the mitochindrial DNA. The resulting run gives you the fraction of reads greater than 5 or 10 depth as well as the average and median read depth.

These scripts are actively being modified and adjusted.
